# Terminal Themed Website

It replicates the terminal feel, inside of a website. You could use this for a portfolio, or just for fun! It has various commands. You can add more as this whole project is open source and under the MIT Licence.

## Inspiration

Forked from [woooferz/terminalweb](https://github.com/woooferz/terminalweb)

I was inspired to create this project by 2 things [LiveTerm](https://liveterm.vercel.app/) ([Source Code](https://github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm)) and ForrestKnight's [fkcode.com](https://fkcodes.com/) (As of writing this it is not working).
